# Givetel/Contactspace Automation Tools
This repository is designed to integrate Givetel's business operations with Contactspace's API tools. This is a public version of the full automation suite that contains no sensitive information.

## Setup
Before using the toolkit, some steps are required.
* You can install all dependent packages using the below.
````
pip install -r utils/requirements.txt
````
* You need to set up a Secrets folder with sensitive keys, passwords etc. This should live in your Givetel_Automation_Public directory and should contain .json files with the sensitive data. You should structure your json files as such:
1. Secrets/cs_credentials.json
````json
{"CS_USER": "your CS username", "CS_PASS": "your CS password", "CS_API": "your CS API key"}
````
Currently this is the only senstive information required in the public version.

## Resources folder
This automation is designed to be usable for non-programmers in the future, so most of the top-level control is done using data in the Resources folder.
This folder contains .xlsx files that anyone should be able to edit. Below are explanations of the functionality of each resource.
1. GiveTel_skillid.xlsx - This file contains all initiative names, initiative ID's, skill ID's, CPC's, Conversion targets and oldest open batch months. When a new campaign is added, it should be added as a row in this spreadsheet with all the relevant information.
2. Givetel_Users.xlsx - This file is automatically generated from the CS API, and contains all users in Givetel's CS system and their user ids.
3. headers.xlsx - This file is maintained by the user similarly to Givetel_skillid. When downloading datasets, some methods in this toolkit have a "transform_headers" parameter. This parameter uses headers.xlsx, and essentially transforms any column headers contained in row 2 and below to the correspending label in row 1. Ie if a header is called "AcqSource" it will be transformed to "Acq Source".
4. outcome_groups - This file is maintained by the user and contains all possible outcomes of a call in column B, with their corresponding outcome group in column A. This allows for the streamlining of outcomes to their respective groups
